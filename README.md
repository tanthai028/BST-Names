# BST-Names
Wrote on a C program that uses BST structure to searches, prints and deletes a list of string names from a text to help familiarize and practice BST structure  
    
Utilized recursion to create fast and efficient functionality in place of loops and BST for itâ€™s efficient sorting algorithm, searching in O(n) runtime complexity as a worst case and O(logn) runtime as the best case

# Usage
For your convenience, here is how you could do it in CMD environment.

1. First compile: gcc bstnames.c
2. After compilation, to run the program, you would type the following command: a.exe

# Output
